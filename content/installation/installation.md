## System requirements

PCGen can be installed on most desktop and laptop computers made in the last ten years.

PCGen supports the Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems.

You will need:

* A recent version of Java (free - see below for instructions)
* 300 MB of hard drive space
* A PDF viewer, such as [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) (free)

## Installing Java

PCGen requires Java to run.

You probably already have Java installed.

If you don't have Java installed, or if your Java version is too old, you can [download and install the latest version](https://java.com/en/download/).

### More help with Java

If PCGen doesn't work for you, a good first step is to 1) uninstall all versions of Java from your computer, then 2) re-install the latest version.

## Installing PCGen

You can get PCGen from the [downloads page](http://pcgen.org/download/).

* Windows users:
    * Get the "Windows Download".
    * Wait for the file to finish downloading.
    * Open the file and follow the install wizard.
    * Start the program from the PCGen entry in your Start Menu.

* If you are a Mac OS X or Linux user:
	* Get the "Zip Download (Universal)".
	* Wait for the file to finish downloading.
	* Extract the zip file into a folder. (It's best to do this in a new, empty folder.)
	* Navigate into the `pcgen` folder and double-click `pcgen.sh` to start the program.
