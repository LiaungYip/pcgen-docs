**<span id="math"></span> Token Name:** x&lt;Mathematical Operator&gt;x

**Variables Used (x):** Number or Numeric Token (Operand).

**Variables Used (y):** Mathematical Operator

**What it does:**

-   Simple mathematical operations are supported in the output sheets.
-   Valid operators include the following:
    -   + (Addition operator).
    -   - (Subtraction operator).
    -   \* (Multiplication operator).
    -   / (Divisor operator).
    -   @ (Divisor operator that returns an integer).
    -   \^ (Exponentiation operator).
    -   INTVAL (Displays just the integer portion of the result).
    -   NOZERO (Displays blank if the result is zero, otherwise displays
        the result with the appropriate sign).
    -   SIGN (Pre-pends a sign (+ or -) to the result. This is ignored
        if it already has a sign).
    -   TRUNC (Displays the integer and the first decimal place of
        the result).
-   Do not use spaces in between the operands and the operator.

**Example:**

`TOTALLEVELS+15`

Displays the total number of levels plus 15.

`(COMBAT.AC.TOTAL-3).INTVAL`

Displays the integer portion of the Combat Armor Class minus 3.

`SKILL.Spot.RANKS*SKILL.Listen.RANKS`

Displays the number of spot ranks multiplied by the number of listen
ranks.

`(SKILLPOINTS.UNUSED/2).TRUNC`

Displays the integer and fist decimal place of the unused skill points
divided by 2.

`(VAR.RangeMod-2).INTVAL.SIGN`

    rely on the count, but on a setting in the preferences. If you
    choose to display WEPONPROFS on your sheet, the filter is ignored.
    If you choose not to, it filters even if you have WEAPONPROFS.

**What it does:**

-   Used for filtering.
-   Where x is the number of appropriate items the character must have
    or the filter will filter out all output until the next filter is
    reached or the filter is ended via the |%| token.
-   Filter can also be a **comma delimited list of Classname=level**
    pairs (where Classname is a valid Class name and level is the
    minimum level of the class for the filter).
-   Classname could also be **SPELLLISTCLASS.x=level** where x is the
    xth spellcasting class of the character.
-   Filter can also be in the form **VAR.name.label.value** where name
    is the name of a defined variable, label is one of EQ (equals), NEQ
    (not equals), LT (less than) LTEQ, (less than equal to), GT (greater
    than), GTEQ (greater than equal to), and value is some value to
    which the named variable is compared. Only 1 filter is active at a
    time (they can't be nested).

**Example:**

`|%WEAPON.3|`

The filter will stop all output (until this filter is ended or the next
filter started) unless the character has at least 3 weapons.

**Example:**

`BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|3*COUNT[FEATNAME=Toughness]`

The count token is used in this example to calculate the total bonus.

`FOR,%num,0,COUNT[SKILLS],1,1          {Statements}          ENDFOR`

The {statements} would be processed for each of the skills the character
has.

`FOR,%spell,0,COUNT[SPELLSINBOOK0.0.0],1,1          {Statements}          ENDFOR`

The {statements} would be processed for each of the 0 ^th^ level spells
in the 1 ^st^ classes 1 ^st^ spellbook (known) that the character has.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="count"></span> Token Name:** count(x,y) - See [jep count
()](/list/global/formulas.html#count) function in the Global Formulas
page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="csheettag2"></span> Token Name:** CSHEETTAG2.x

**Variables Used (x):** Symbol (Replacement symbol for the default
"\\").

**What it does:**

Changes the delimiter used by embedded DFOR/FOR loops to the character
specified.

**Example:**

`CSHEETTAG2.~          DFOR.0,(COUNT[SKILLS]+1)/2,1,COUNT[SKILLS],(COUNT[SKILLS]+1)/2,<td>~SKILL%~</td> <td>~SKILL%.TOTAL~</td><td>~SKILL%.RANK~</td>          <td>~SKILL%.ABILITY~</td><td>~SKILL%.MOD~,<tr align="center">,</tr>,0`

This would change the field delimiter from the default "\\" character
for "\~". This allows the FOR/DFOR loop to be used in RTF output which
does not allow the "\\" character to be used

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="dfor"></span> Token Name:** DFOR.r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z

**Variables Used (r):** Number (The initial value).

**Variables Used (s):** Number (Limit for new line progression).

**Variables Used (t):** Number (Value added once per line).

**Variables Used (u):** Number (Limit for in line progression).

**Variables Used (v):** Number (Value added in line until totalMax is
passed).

**Variables Used (w):** Text (The phrase is the code that is parsed for
tokens - use \\'s instead of |'s, and the % within the tokens will be
replaced with the actual value of the index).

**Variables Used (x):** Text (The text that will be printed at the
beginning of the for loop and after the Variable "y").

**Variables Used (y):** Text (The text that will be printed every time
through the loop).

**Variables Used (z):** Number (The loop will break when no more items
are found before the natural end of the loop (max) if exists is 1. If
exists is 2 and the charactersheet is currently within a filter, PCGen
will not print anything else until the end of the filter |%| is reached
or another filter is begun. 0 means it will always loop to the natural
end of the loop.).

**What it does:**

-   Creates loop processing of statements. This is very similar to the
    FOR loop, except this allows for stepping across the table (in the
    same line) independent of stepping down.
-   The initial value is **r** , the values going down are found by
    adding **t** to **r** once for each line.
-   To find the value within the same line, this starting value ( **r**
    for the first line, **r** + **t** for the next, etc.) has **v**
    added to it, this is done as may times until **u** is passed.
-   Likewise, **t** is added to **r** each line until **s** is passed.
-   The same logic that handles the FOR loop handles the DFOR loop.
-   The display of the output can be controlled via the COMMA and CRLF
    iteration terminators.

**Example:**

`DFOR.0,(COUNT[SKILLS]+1)/2,1,COUNT[SKILLS], (COUNT[SKILLS]+1)/2,<td>\SKILL%\</td>          <td>\SKILL%.TOTAL\</td><td>\SKILL%.RANK\</td>          <td>\SKILL%.ABILITY\</td><td>\SKILL%.MOD\,<tr align="center">,</tr>,0`

Produces a 2 column row table of all skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="dir"></span> Token Name:** DIR.x

**Variables Used (x):** Text (Directory Option).

-   PCG - Displays the PCGen Character file (.PCG) directory.
-   PCGen - Displays the PCGen System Directory.
-   HTML - Displays the PCGen Character Output HTML directory.
-   TEMP - Displays the system TEMP directory.
-   TEMPLATES - Displays the PCGen Character Output Template directory.

**What it does:**

Displays File output paths.

**Example:**

`DIR.PCGen`

Would display " `D:\RPG\PCGen\system` " if PCGen was installed in "
`D:\RPG\PCGen` ".

`DIR.TEMPLATES`

Would display " `D:\RPG\PCGen\outputsheets\d20\fantasy` " if PCGen was
installed in " `D:\RPG\PCGen` ".

`DIR.PCG`

Would display " `D:\RPG\PCGen\characters` " if PCGen was installed in "
`D:\RPG\PCGen` ".

`DIR.html`

Would display " `D:\RPG\PCGen\outputsheets\d20\fantasy\htmlxml` " if
PCGen was installed in " `D:\RPG\PCGen` ".

`DIR.TEMP`

Would display " `C:\Temp` " if that was the Operating System's temp
directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="export"></span> Token Name:** EXPORT.x

**Variables Used (x):** Text (Export Option).

-   DATE - Displays the date of export.
-   TIME - Displays the time of export.
-   VERSION - Displays the version of PCGen used to export
    the character.

**What it does:**

Displays character export details.

**Example:**

`EXPORT.DATE`

Displays the date of export.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="for"></span> Token Name:** FOR,%v,w,x,y,z

`FOR,%v,w,x,y,z          {Statements}          ENDFOR`

**Variables Used (v):** Text (Variable Name).

**Variables Used (w):** Number (The initial value).

**Variables Used (x):** Number (Limit for new line progression - You may
use a number, COUNT token, STRLEN token or any valid csheet token).

**Variables Used (y):** Number (Value added once per line).

**Variables Used (z):** Number (The loop will break when no more items
are found before the natural end of the loop (max) if exists is 1. If
exists is 2 and the charactersheet is currently within a filter, PCGen
will not print anything else until the end of the filter |%| is reached
or another filter is begun).

**What it does:**

-   Creates loop processing of statements.
-   Nested FOR loops are supported.
-   The FOR and ENDFOR tokens must be at the start of the line or they
    will not function properly.
-   STRLEN takes the form of STRLEN\[stringtobecounted\] and returns the
    number of characters in the string.

**Example:**

`FOR,%test,0,20-STRLEN[SKILL.%skill],1,0          {Statements}          ENDFOR`

Counts from 0 to 20 minus the sting length of the skill name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Token Name:** FOR.t,u,v,w,x,y,z

**Variables Used (t):** Number (Loop control variable initial value)

**Variables Used (u):** Number (Loop control variable max limit)

**Variables Used (v):** Number (Loop control variable increment value)

**Variables Used (w):** Text (Code phrase to be parsed for tokens)

**Variables Used (x):** Text (Text output at the beginning of the loop)

**Variables Used (y):** Text (Text output at the end of each loop)

**Variables Used (z):** Number (Loop break switch, 1 or 2)

**What it does:**

-   Creates loops for processing of statements and is the only FOR loop
    type that can be used for a party sheet.
-   This style of FOR loop does not support nesting without the
    double-backslash (\\\\).
-   The code phrase to be parsed must use backslashes's (\\) instead of
    pipe's (|), and the percent sign (%) within the tokens will be
    replaced with the actual value of the index.
-   If you have a `FOR.` loop involving the characters within the party
    for-loop, you must enclose the character for-loop in
    double-backslash (\\\\) token markers.
-   `FOR.` loop on party sheets ( <span class="lstfile"> psheet\*.\*
    </span> ) can only loop on character numbers, so `\\%.NAME\\`
    is valid.
-   You may use the special keywords **COMMA** or **NONE** for either
    **x** or **y** (COMMA prints out a comma and NONE prints
    out nothing)
-   **STRLEN** takes the form of `STRLEN[stringtobecounted]` and returns
    the number of characters in the string.
-   The loop break switch, parameter (z), determines when the loop
    breaks:
    -   With z=1, the loop will break at the natural end of the
        loop, i.e. the loop continues until the control variable reaches
        the max limit per parameter (u).
    -   With z=2, and with a character sheet currently within a filter,
        PCGen will not print anything else until the end of the
        filtering loop is reached, or another filter is begun.

**Example:**

`<table>`

`|FOR.0,10,1,[td]`

`\\%.FOR.0,100,1,\SKILL%\,(,),2\\`

`,<tr>,</tr>,1|`

`</table>`

Produces a list of all the party member's skills.

`<table>`

`|FOR.0,100,1,`

`\\%.NAME\\`

`,[ , ],1|`

`<table>`

Produces a list of all the party member's names.

**Token Name:** IIF(SKILL.UNTRAINED,x,y)

**Variables Used (x):** Text (Result if usable untrained).

**Variables Used (y):** Text (Result if usable trained).

**What it does:**

-   Prints out **x** if the skill is usable untrained or **y** if not
    usable untrained.
-   If **y** is not supplied, nothing is printed if trained only, and
    **x** is printed if usable untrained.
-   If neither **x** nor **y** are supplied, nothing is output and the
    output sheet wastes processor cycles.

**Example:**

`IIF(SKILL%.UNTRAINED,YES,NO)`

**<span id="manualwhitespace"></span> Token Name:** MANUALWHITESPACE

`MANUALWHITESPACE          {Statements}          ENDMANUALWHITESPACE     `

**What it does:**

Marks a section where the author does not want white space added to the
output sheet. If white space is desired the |BR| tag can be used, or a
sheet format specific entry such as &nbsp; can be used in the sheet
definition.

Within a manual whitespace section, all whitespace in the output sheet
i.e. all newlines, spaces, tabs, etc. disappears. Whitespace inside the
text of returned from a OS token is preserved however. All leading and
trailing whitespace is trimmed, as is normally done.

**Example:**

`|MANUALWHITESPACE| 1&nbsp;          |PLAYERNAME|          2 3<br>          4          |ENDMANUALWHITESPACE|`

-   Limits the length of the string written to the output sheet to no
    more than x characters.
-   Must be the first subtoken.

**Example:**

`SUB10.SPELLMEM.0.0.0.0.COMPONENTS`

`|FOR,%temp,0,COUNT[TEMPBONUSNAMES]-1,1,0|`

`|TEMPBONUS.%temp|`

`|ENDFOR|`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="text"></span> Token Name:** TEXT.x.y

**Variables Used (x):** LOWER

**Variables Used (x):** LOWERCASE

**Variables Used (x):** REPLACEALL

**Variables Used (x):** REPLACEFIRST

**Variables Used (x):** SENTENCE

**Variables Used (x):** SENTENCECASE

**Variables Used (x):** TITLE

**Variables Used (x):** TITLECASE

**Variables Used (x):** UPPER

**Variables Used (x):** UPPERCASE

**Variables Used (x):** NUMSUFFIX

**Variables Used (y):** Subtoken (OS Token)

**Variables Used (y):** Number

**What it does:**

Alters the output of the following OS token. For it to work it has to be
the first subtoken. The following are the subrags allowed and their
effect.

-   `LENGTH` - Returns the length of the string the specified
    token produces. (Mostly useful to test for 0 length strings)
-   `LOWER` , `LOWERCASE` - Output the tag result in lower case. e.g.
    the vitamins are in my fresh brussels sprouts
-   `NUMSUFFIX` - Output a numeric suffix appropriate for the
    tag result. e.g "th" or "rd"
-   `REPLACEALL` and `REPLACEFIRST` - Performs a regular expression
    based search and replace on the string produced by the
    associated token. Multiple replacements can be specified and are
    processed right to left. The proper syntax for these tags are as
    follows:
    -   `REPLACEALL{regexp,newtest}`
    -   `REPLACEFIRST{regexp,newtest}`
    -   When writing regular expressions you may need to use character
        substitution to get the results you are looking for. Examples:
        -   "\_\_LP\_\_" as the substitute for "{"
        -   "\_\_RP\_\_" as the substitute for "}"
        -   "\_\_PLUS\_\_" as the substitute for "+"
        -   Note: Help on regular expressions can be found at the [Java
            Platform 
            Pattern](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) page.
-   `SENTENCE` , `SENTENCECASE` - Output the tag result in
    sentence case. e.g. The vitamins are in my fresh brussels sprouts
-   `TITLE` , `TITLECASE` - Output the tag result in title case. e.g.
    The Vitamins Are In My Fresh Brussels Sprouts
-   `UPPER` , `UPPERCASE` - Output the tag result in upper case. e.g.
    THE VITAMINS ARE IN MY FRESH BRUSSELS SPROUTS

**Example:**

`TEXT.LOWER.SPELLMEM.%class.0.%level.%spell.NAME`

Would output the name for the spell in lower case.

`TEXT.REPLACEFIRST{\.0,}.SKILL.%skill.RANK`

Would output "5" instead of "5.0" but would leave "5.5" as is.

`TEXT.NUMSUFFIX.22`

Would output a suffix of "nd" rather than the value 22.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**<span id="var"></span> Token Name:** VAR.x

**Variables Used (x):** Text (Any defined variable name).

**What it does:**

-   Displays the value of a defined variable.
-   The default is with one decimal place of precision (i.e. x.x).
-   You can also append .INTVAL as an optional argument which displays
    the result with no decimal points (as an integer).
-   It is possible to define the Turn Undead variable more than once.
    The program keeps track of this. (say one instance is 2 and the
    other 4).
-   Also `.MINVAL` should be included if instead of the default maximum
    of multiple defines, you want the minimum.

**Example:**

`VAR.Turn Undead.MINVAL.INTVAL`

Would return 2.

`VAR.Turn Undead.INTVAL`

Would return 4.

`VAR.Turn Undead.MINVAL`

Would return 2.0.

`VAR.Turn Undead`

Would return 4.0.
