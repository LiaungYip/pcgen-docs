**Examples:**

`EQSLOT:Hand CONTAINS:Glove=1 NUMBER:HANDS`

This defines a Hand slot, of which there are 2 each of which can hold 1
Glove.

`EQSLOT:Fingers CONTAINS:Ring=2 NUMBER:TORSO`

This defines a Fingers slot which can hold 2 Rings. The number of slots
is defined using the TORSO type because a character can only wear 2
rings at any one time regardless of the number of hands the character
might have. The TORSO type is useful if you need the slot number to
remain static, many creatures have non standard numbers of arms, legs,
heads etc. but all creatures have only one TORSO.

This defines a Skin slot which can hold 20 items of TYPE:PsionicTattoo.

`EQSLOT:Body CONTAINS:Armor,Robe=1 NUMBER:TORSO`
